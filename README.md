# **Survival Prediction for Breast Cancer Patients**

Predict Outcomes, Support Treatment Decisions, Empower Clinical Insight

---

## **Overview**

**Survival Prediction for Breast Cancer Patients** is a machine learning-based analytical framework designed to forecast patient survival outcomes and estimate survival time for high-risk cases. The project integrates clinical data preprocessing, predictive model development, and performance evaluation to support early prognosis and personalized treatment planning in oncology.

The system enhances clinical decision-making by transforming patient health metrics into actionable survival risk assessments.
